        You can continue using your existing password.<br />           
        <br />       
        User ID : @USER_NAME_OR_USER_CODE@<br />        
        <br />
        You have ONE TIME option to change your User ID using the management portal or the POS. The User ID needs to be a minimum of @MIN_UID_LENGTH@
        characters (Numeric only, Alphabets only, Combination of Numeric and Alphabets).<br />
